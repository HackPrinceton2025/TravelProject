# Project Root
Project Brief: AI Group Travel Agent
## 1. 🚀 Project Goal
To build a real-time group chat application where a collaborative AI agent assists a group in planning a trip. The AI will provide personalized recommendations based on both pre-set user preferences and the live context of the chat conversation.
## 2. 📋 Core Features
### Group Chat & AI Integration
A real-time chat room where users can talk to each other and summon the AI (e.g., @ai_agent).
### User Preference Onboarding
When joining a group, each user provides their individual travel preferences (budget, available dates, interests, dietary restrictions, etc.).
### Context-Aware AI
The AI agent's recommendations are based on three sources of information:

* User Preferences: All group members' stored preferences.
* Chat Context (Short-Term): The most recent messages in the chat.
* Chat Context (Long-Term): A summary of the older chat history.

### Tool-Based Recommendations
The AI can find and suggest specific hotels, flights, restaurants, and events based on group consensus and constraints.
### Voting System
Users can upvote/downvote AI suggestions (hotels, restaurants) to reach a decision.
### Map Visualization
(If time permits) Show suggested locations on an interactive map.
### Receipt Splitting
(If time permits) Use OCR to scan and split receipts.
